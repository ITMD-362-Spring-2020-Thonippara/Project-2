        <p>The International Society for Universal Dialogue</p>
        <p>ISUD XII World Congress</p>
        <p>PHILOSOPHY IN AN AGE OF CRISIS: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS</p>
        <p>Lima, Peru</p>
        <p>July 10-15, 2018</p>
        <p>The hosting institution was the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP).</p>
        <p>The goal of this World Congress is to promote dialogue concerning various crucial philosophical issues in today’s world 
          and to explore the role of philosophy in our complicated times. The world we live in today faces many urgent 
          issues that require sustained and productive cross-cultural dialogue. The ideals of global peace and security 
          remain elusive while a sense of uncertainty pervades the dominant institutions of contemporary life. Traditional 
          human values underlying our social and political institutions are continually transformed by new developments 
          in information technology, digitalization, artificial intelligence, and the drive for economic efficiency. 
          Although the globalization of trade and technology has brought people together as never before, our differing 
          outlooks, habits, and ideologies continue to separate us.</p>
        <p>As philosophers, we must neither shut ourselves in ivory towers nor indulge ourselves with armchair philosophy. 
          We must face the issues that define our moment in history. Our times demand that we, as philosophers, work to foster 
          intellectual insight, imagination, social responsibility, and justice. Therefore, the International Society for Universal 
          Dialogue issues a call for papers and proposals for panels for the 12th World Congress of ISUD on the general theme of 
          “Philosophy in an Age of Crisis: Challenges and Prospects”, with the following sub-themes:</p>

          <li>The ivory tower and social involvement</li>
